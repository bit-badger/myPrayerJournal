    <p>myPrayerJournal is a place where individuals can record their prayer requests, record that they prayed for them,
    update them as God moves in the situation, and record a final answer received on that request.&nbsp; It will also
    allow individuals to review their answered prayers.</p>
    <p>This site is currently in very limited alpha, as it is being developed with a core group of test
    users.&nbsp; If this is something you are interested in using, check back around mid-November 2016 to check on the
    development progress.</p>
