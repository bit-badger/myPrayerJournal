    myPrayerJournal is a place where individuals can record their prayer requests, record that they prayed for them,
    update them as God moves in the situation, and record a final answer received on that request.  It will also allow
    individuals to review their answered prayers.

    This site is currently in very limited alpha, as it is being developed with a core group of test users.  If this is
    something you are interested in using, check back around mid-June 2017 to check on the development progress.
